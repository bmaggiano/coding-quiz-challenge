# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

This project is a coding quiz challenge that asks a user to complete a quiz under the pressure of time and penalties for wrong answers. After the user completes the coding quiz, they are presented the opportunity to submit their initials and score to be stored in the local storage. The basis of this project is to understand that you can build a fully functioning web app with very little HTML markup. A lot of the background of this project is understanding APIs and navigating your way around the DOM. A lot of methods were used including functions, anonymous functions, callback functions, reference elements from the HTML in the js file, and so much more. This was an essential project to solidify the teachings of vanilla Javascript so far.
